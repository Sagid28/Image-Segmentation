# Anomaly Detection on Washer Dataset

## Problem Statement

The project aims to perform anomaly detection on a washer dataset using advanced learning algorithms, including the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and its variations. The model is trained on the "washer_ok" dataset and subsequently tested on the "washer_ng" dataset. The objective is to predict and detect anomalies while generating informative heat maps.

## Overview

Anomaly detection is a pivotal task within the realm of Computer Vision. This project explores the utilization of "Image Segmentation" techniques for anomaly detection, showcasing the power of cutting-edge algorithms. Four distinct algorithms have been applied to the dataset, each meticulously selected after comprehensive analysis and research. The resultant application of these algorithms contributes to the detection of anomalies.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of RGB images portraying various instances of washers:

- `washer_ok`: 30 images
- `washer_ng`: 92 images

## Algorithms

The project incorporates the following sophisticated algorithms to address the anomaly detection task:

1. **Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)**: The VAE algorithm is at the core of anomaly detection, capturing latent patterns within the washer dataset.

2. **U-Net**: Leveraging the U-Net architecture, the model showcases its ability to segment washer images accurately and identify anomalies.

3. **U-Net Xception Style**: A variant inspired by Xception, this algorithm enhances anomaly detection with its unique approach.

4. **MultiResUnet**: Employing a multi-resolution strategy, the MultiResUnet algorithm further refines anomaly detection.
